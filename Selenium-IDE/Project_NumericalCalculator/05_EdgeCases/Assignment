Edge Cases

§ Test the application with edge cases:

§ Dividing by zero (you will find a bug here; the correct text should read: Invalid Calculation but it's not)

§ Test the application's response to negative numbers.

§ Verify the application's handling of decimal numbers.

§ Check if leading and trailing spaces in input fields are managed correctly.

§ Try calculating with "Infinity".
