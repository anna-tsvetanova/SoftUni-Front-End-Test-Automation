Create a test script that attempts to log in with an invalid username, checks the error message, and then retries with a valid username. 
Use conditional logic to handle the error scenario.


Login Attempt with Invalid User:

▪ Locate the username field and enter user123.

▪ Locate the password field and enter secret_sauce.

▪ Click on the login button.


Verify Error Message:

▪ Assert that the error message displayed is: "Epic sadface: Username and password do not match any user in this service".


Conditional Retry:

▪ Hint: Use store text and if structure for this part.

▪ Use the if command to check if the error message is present.

▪ If the error message is found, print "Wrong username" and retry with valid credentials.


Login Attempt with Valid User:

▪ Locate the username field and enter standard_user.

▪ Locate the password field and enter secret_sauce.

▪ Click on the login button.


Verify Successful Login:

▪ Assert that the page title is "Products".

▪ Print "Successful login".
