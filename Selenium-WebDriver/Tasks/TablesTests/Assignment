Working with Web Tables 

Many web pages need to show data in a clear, organized way. Usually, a web table element is used for this. 
A web table is an HTML element represented by the <table> tag. It contains other HTML elements, making it a container HTML element. Here is what 
a <table> tag can include: 

The table created using the preceding elements will be displayed in the browser as a web table: 

The scenario we will use to work with a web table is again from the http://practice.bpbonline.com/ application. 
The home page of this website shows a list of products. In the background, this list is actually a web table.  

On the home page products are listed as follows: 

 We can see the <table> tag, which includes a <tbody>. Inside, there are three <tr> tags representing table rows. 
Each row contains three <td> tags representing columns. The <td> tags include two anchor elements for the product image and product page, 
as well as text displaying the product's price. 

▪ By the end of this exercise, you will be able to: 

Traverse a web table and extract information. 

Save the extracted information to a CSV file. 

 

▪ Open the application using the URL: http://practice.bpbonline.com/. Use either driver.Url or driver.Navigate().GoToUrl() to navigate to the URL. 

▪ Identify the web table on the home page. Use XPath to locate the web table on the home page. 

▪ Find all rows in the web table.

▪ Create a CSV file to save product information.

This optional step ensures that if a CSV file with the same name already exists in the specified location, it will be deleted before creating a new one. 
This prevents appending data to an old file and ensures that each test run generates a fresh CSV file with only the current data. 

 
Traverse through table rows to find the table columns.

Loop through each row and then each column within the row. 

Extract the text from each cell, split the text to separate product name and cost, and format it. 

Append the formatted text to the CSV file. 

 

 

Use assertions to check that the CSV file was created and is not empty. 

 

 

Check how the file looks like in the bin à Debug à net{version} directory 

 

 

Note: Keep in mind that the products might be slightly different, as they change each month.
